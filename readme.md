Welcome to my full stack ecommerce website!
---
This site is created using django to create a RESTful backend API and for database management. This supports an interactive React Frontend which features cookie management to store user cart data. This allows users to add items to their cart, navigate away from the site, and return with their cart data persisting.
<br><br>This project has taught me a lot about API development to allow for database interaction from the user-facing frontend. I have also learned about database design through django's intuitive models system. After work on this project, I am a more capable web developer with deeper knowledge of mangaing a full software stack.
<br><br>
If you are a recruiter looking for a capable software developer, please check out my [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/FrickTob/FrickTob.github.io) for my contact info and to see other projects I've been working on.
